INTENT
-----------------
To develop an open source prototype of a interactive dashboard to monitor human trafficking patterns. 


PROJECT OVERVIEW
-----------------
This project was conceived at the first Hackathon on immigration. Hosted by La Opinion in Los Angeles, CA on 12/8/2012 - 12//9/2012. The twitter hashtag was #LAMigraHack

The original idea from Juan Gallardo was to have a live dashboard overviewed on a map that predicts the movement of suspects of human trafficking. Certain activities could trigger alers, predict travel routes or suspects, and alert relevant agencies to make arrests. 

The actual implementation would exceed the length of the hackathon. It was decided to have a minimum viable product to show entry points, hypothetical destinations based on arrests of suspects, and run a simulation. 


MISSION
-----------------
The dashboard will serve two markets: consumer and law enforcement. 

__Consumers__
We believe that by educationg consumers, they can be empowered to do any of the following
<ol>
	<li>Make more informed decisions about their spending habits to stop or reduce the financial transactions that directly or indirectly support organizations that employ forced labor.</li>  
	<li>Assist with planning travels to avoid known hotspots as shown in trends or updated crowd sourced data.</li>  
	<li>Inform about human rights abuses and link them to support organizations fighting forced labor.</li>  
	<li>Enable informers to make reports about suspicious activity.</li> 
</ol>

__Law Enforcement__
<ol>
	<li> Enable law enforcement to alert travelers about suspected activity.</li> 
	<li> Plan surveillance acitivites based on arrest and report trends.</li>
	<li> Plan checkpoints to stop suspects.</li>
	<li> Alerts of suspects and their movement.</li> 
	<li> Enable more interagency collaboration.</li> 
</ol>
